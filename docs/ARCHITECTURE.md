# Architecture

## Overview

`llm-proxy-pii-rust` is a reverse proxy in front of an OpenAI-compatible LLM
provider. It inspects each request, anonymizes PII locally, forwards the
anonymized request upstream, and restores the original values in the response.

## Design principles

- **Local-first** — PII detection runs on-box; nothing leaves for the filtering step.
- **Modular pipeline** — request/response transformations are `Stage`s. Only the
  privacy stage is wired now, but auth / rate-limit / logging can be added later
  without touching the core.
- **Engine-agnostic detection** — everything sits behind the `PiiDetector` trait,
  so we can swap models or add engines without touching the proxy.
- **CPU-first, GPU later** — correctness and reproducibility on CPU first; GPU is
  an optimization milestone (M4) behind a feature flag. GPU behavior isn't
  automatic — it depends on the model and quantization.
- **Textbook & lean** — idiomatic Rust, low RAM/CPU, no over-engineering.

## Hybrid detection (key decision)

Two classes of PII, handled differently:

| Class        | Examples                              | Engine |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Structured   | email, phone, SSN, credit card, IBAN, secret | deterministic regex + validation (Luhn, IBAN checksum) — high precision, no model |
| Unstructured | names, organizations, locations       | ONNX NER model (M2) |

The old proxy's ONNX `openai/privacy-filter` was unreliable on the ML part.
Keeping deterministic recognizers for structured PII removes most of the
reliability risk *and* most of the compute cost — the ML model only carries the
unstructured-entity load.

## Anonymization

Detected spans are replaced with typed placeholders of the form `[KIND_N]` — e.g.
`[EMAIL_1]`, `[PERSON_2]` — ASCII and tokenizer-friendly. A per-request `Vault`
maps placeholder → original so the response can be restored exactly (round-trip).
Text with no PII passes through unchanged.

## Prompt augmentation (helping the model read placeholders)

The downstream model sees only masked values, so it must be told how to read
them — otherwise it can mishandle them, especially in tool calls (treating
`[EMAIL_1]` as literal noise instead of a stand-in for an email). The privacy
stage therefore **transparently injects a system instruction** into the outgoing
request, stating that:

- values like `[EMAIL_1]`, `[PERSON_2]` are placeholders standing in for real
  data of the named type;
- they must be used verbatim — including as tool-call arguments — never altered
  or guessed at;
- they will be restored downstream before anyone real sees them.

This expands the round-trip scope:

- **Tool calls are in scope** — `tool_calls` arguments in the response are
  de-anonymized (so the client runs tools with real values), and tool *result*
  messages coming back are re-anonymized before going upstream. It is not just
  chat message text.
- **Placeholder assignment is deterministic** — the same real value maps to the
  same placeholder every time it appears, so the model can correlate it across a
  multi-turn (stateless) conversation where history is re-sent and re-masked on
  each request.

## Module layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/main.rs` | binary entry: tracing, config, run server |
| `src/config.rs` | runtime configuration |
| `src/server.rs` | axum router + handlers |
| `src/proxy.rs` | forwarding + pipeline application (streaming-capable) |
| `src/pipeline/mod.rs` | `Stage` trait |
| `src/pipeline/privacy.rs` | the privacy stage (only one wired) |
| `src/pii/mod.rs` | `PiiDetector` trait, `PiiEntity` / `PiiKind` |
| `src/pii/recognizers.rs` | deterministic structured-PII recognizers (M1) |
| `src/pii/anonymizer.rs` | `Vault`: mask / demask |
| `src/pii/onnx.rs` | ONNX NER detector (M2, feature `onnx`) |

## Stack

tokio (async runtime) · axum + tower (HTTP + modular layers) · reqwest (upstream,
streaming) · serde / serde_json · regex + once_cell (recognizers) · `ort` (ONNX
Runtime, added at M2) · `tokenizers` (M2).

**Toolchain:** Rust with the **MSVC** target on Windows. On a machine without
admin rights, install rustup per-user and the MSVC linker via portable Build Tools
— full procedure in `docs/SETUP.md`. MSVC is required to link the `ort` / ONNX
Runtime native library at M2.

## Decisions & open points

- **Placeholder format: `[KIND_N]`** (e.g. `[EMAIL_1]`) — ASCII, tokenizer-friendly.
- **Locales: IT + US** — Italian and US phone numbers; IBAN including Italian; US SSN.
- Open: exact `Stage` signature for threading the per-request `Vault` from request
  to response (finalized in M1).
- Open: which text fields of the OpenAI schema are scanned (messages, tool
  results, `tool_calls` arguments…).
